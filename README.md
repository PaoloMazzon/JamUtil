JamUtil
=======
JamUtil is a very simple little framework meant to be used on top of [Vulkan2D](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/Vulkan2D)
with the purpose being use in game jams. These tools are not the best in class, they are just
easy to use on top of VK2D since game jams have very limited time.

Planned Features
================

 + Audio library
 + Asset management for textures and audio
 + Basic game math/physics
 + Some collisions
 
Usage
=====
This is meant to be used the same way Vulkan2D is, in that you just add it as a submodule
and include the few files in your CMake manually.
